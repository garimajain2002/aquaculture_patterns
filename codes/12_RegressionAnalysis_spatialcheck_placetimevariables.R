# RQ1: In what ways is the aquaculture land transition related to salinity prevalence and history of storm surges,
# accounting for place-invariant factors such as distance/elevation from the sea or soil conditions, or time based shocks such as policy changes, inflation, or market conditions

# RQ2: How do these relationships vary by states? 

# Optional RQ3: Is there a predictive lag between surge impact and land change outcome? 


# Aquaculture Analysis: Panel Data Regression Models
# This script analyzes the relationship between aquaculture land change, storm surges, salinity, and other socio-environmental factors

# As Moran's I is positive, we need to also account for spatial autocorrelation, ie villages near each other tend to have simlar levels of aquaculture => the residuals in the regression may also be spatially autocorrelated violating the classical assumption about independence. 
# vcov at the village level corrects for within-unit correlation over time (serial correlation), and heteroskedasticity within village clusters 
# it does not adjust for spatial dependence between nearby villages
# Try spatially clustered standard errors - Conley Standard Errors that adjust for spatial correlation across observations within a specified distance (5km, 10km...)


# Apart from Tiem and Place FE, we also need to control for place-specific time variant factors that may have their own impact on aquaculture.
# These could be state level policies in a year, level of urbanization and infrastructure, or rainfall (more rains => better agricultural output = less likely to shift) 
# Add these as additional controls and check results

# Holding the year constant, when comparing across places, Villages in post-surge years have, on average, 0.608 units higher 5-year average salinity, compared to not affected places. 
# Note that this is a pooled estimate across all villages without controlling for baseline salinity differences between villages.
# This only explains 10% of the variation, and RMSE = 0.8 implies prediction errors are fairly large. 

# Village + Time FE
# This controls for any time-invariant village-level characteristics, like soil type, geographical location with respect to the sea, persistent farming practices, etc.
# When comparing villages to themselves overtime, the relationship of salinity with surges reverses, that is within a given village, salinity is lower by 0.066 units in post-surge periods compared to pre-surge periods.
# Within RÂ² = 0.00022: only a tiny portion of within-village variation in salinity is explained by postSurge.
# This suggests that there maybe systematic differences between places that are affected vs not affected by storms. Those affected by storms are likley to have a higher salinity baseline. 
# while places that are affected by surges have a higher baseline salinity (i.e. are more likely to be saline), they experience relatively less salinity after being affected by storms.

# In non-saline areas, a surge year increases aquaculture by ~0.11% point.
# In non-surge years, a 1-unit increase in salinity increases aquaculture by ~0.24% point.
# After a surge, the effect of salinity on aquaculture is lower by 0.16 â Total effect of salinity = 0.24 â 0.16 = ~0.08.
# Salinity is positively associated with aquaculture in normal years.
# After a surge, the strength of that association weakens â perhaps because surge acts as a shock to the existing aquaculture practices or immediate recovery efforts shift behavior.

# Time and village FE: 
# Surges increase aquaculture in low-salinity areas - In villages with zero salinity, surges are associated with a +0.12% point increase in aquaculture.
# Salinity alone does not predict aquaculture in normal years (not significant) - In non-surge years, salinity has a small and statistically insignificant effect on aquaculture.
# Surges amplify salinity-driven aquaculture expansion - After a surge, the effect of salinity increases by ~0.09% point per unit of salinity.
# In normal years, salinity does not have an impact on aquaculture uptake, however, after a surge, salinity becomes a stronger driver of aquaculture.
# This points to interactive adaptation: when a surge occurs in already saline areas, people are more likely to expand aquaculture.
# In villages already facing salinity, storm surges amplify the move toward aquaculture.
# It is not just the surge or salinity alone, but salinity post-surge that accelerates aquaculture expansion.

# Comparing Model 3 and 4 -
# Adding State Ã Year fixed effects in Model 4 reveals that the previously positive average association between storm surges and aquaculture disappears â even turning negative â once state-specific annual shocks are controlled for. 
# However, the interaction between storm surges and persistent salinity becomes even stronger, suggesting that aquaculture expansion is not a generalized response to storm events, but a targeted adaptation in areas where salinity stress is already high. 
# The stable model fit (RÂ²) across specifications indicates that this interaction captures the key localized environmental mechanism driving change, beyond what is explained by broader policy or macroeconomic trends.


# The fact that Conley SEs are larger means that spatial correlation is present â nearby villages are likely experiencing similar shocks or environmental conditions.
# In other words, storm surges and salinity cluster spatially. This validates the core hypothesis that aquaculture expansion is geographically concentrated in areas affected by surges and salinity.
# Significance disappears not because the effect is gone, but because standard errors are now more realistic â accounting for spatial dependence that clustered SEs alone miss.
# The effect sizes (coefficients) remain nearly identical even after controlling for State Ã Year and spatial SEs â they don't shrink.
# The RÂ² stays flat (~0.746â0.747) across all models. This shows: the model fit is stable. Adding spatial controls doesnât explain much more variation, meaning that postSurge and salinity already capture meaningful variation in aquaculture.

# Although the statistical significance of postSurge and persistent salinity weakens under spatial standard errors, 
# the coefficient magnitudes remain robust across specifications. This suggests that their impact on aquaculture is not spurious but embedded in spatially clustered dynamics. 
# In fact, the loss of precision reflects the very nature of the processes we study: storm surges and salinization are spatially concentrated phenomena. 
# The consistency in RÂ² and effect sizes across models confirms the substantive importance of these variables.

# Interpretation: 
# TN - Surges have a big positive effect on aquaculture; long-run salinity has a small negative effect, salinity may amplify surge effect, but not significantly. 
# AP - Surges alone are less impacxtful as compared to TN, but salinity is strongly positively associated with aquaculture. Surges in high saline conditions tend to trigger aquaculture expansion the most in AP. 
# OD - Surges have a weak or even negative effect on aqua expansion. Salinity has a more positive response to aquaculture compared to TN. Surges in high saline places have small negative effect, however not significant.

# Linear effect not significant alone
# Strong curvature effect â suggests increasing returns to salinity for aquaculture in TN.
# Some state-specific nonlinear salinity effects â e.g., salinity effects are stronger OD in higher-order terms.
# A massive, positive coefficient â suggests that in AP, aquaculture after a surge responds very strongly to salinity - maybe visualise it? 

# 5-year average salinity has a nonlinear (convex) effect, meaning aquaculture increases at higher levels of salinity.
# In AP - Aquaculture is highly sensitive to salinity after a surge (strong positive interaction), implying surge and salinity may be joint enablers of expansion.
# In OD - Surge Ã salinity interactions are not significant. Salinity increases aquaculture moderately, but surge may disrupt or delay response.
# Lagged aquaculture is very predictive â suggesting strong path dependence or persistence in village-level aquaculture.

# postSurge x poly(...)1 => after surge, salinity has a more positive effect on aquaculture in TN
# StateAP x poly(...)1 => In AP, salinity effect is more positive/nonlinear than in TN
# postSurge x salinity x StateOD => After surge, Odisha sees a reduced or negative nonlinear effect of salinity on aquaculture

# Aquaculture increases after storm surges on average, but the effect is state-specific.
# The relationship between salinity and aquaculture is clearly U-shaped, i.e. Salinityâaquaculture relationship is nonlinear, but varies by state:
# In AP, high salinity after surges strongly increases aquaculture (adaptive behavior).
# In OD, the surge reduces aquaculture (â1.66), with modest nonlinear effects from salinity. The interaction with surge seems to reverse the potential adaptation to aquacultre - presents itself as a shock. 
# No strong national-level salinity Ã surge interaction, but clear heterogeneity across states.

# Policy implications
# Supports the hypothesis of adaptive aquaculture expansion in response to salinization, especially in AP after surges.
# Emphasizes the importance of regional differences â Odisha may not have similar coping strategies or infrastructure.
# Suggests salinity impacts are nonlinear, which is important for designing thresholds/interventions.

# Past aquaculture is a significant predictor of future salinity, despite severe controls and spatial error handling



# These results provide strong empirical evidence of a lagged ecological feedback from human adaptation (aquaculture expansion) to system degradation (salinization). Even after removing the "zero-aquaculture" villages (which might dilute the effect), you still observe a statistically robust and consistent association.
# The effect persists across model specifications; The postSurge control confirms the model isn't confounded by extreme weather shocks
# The magnitude is modest but credible for environmental change processes. It is likley modest, because the impact of aquculture on salinity is more localised (in the absolute neighborhoods of the aquaculture ponds which is averaged across the village)
