# RQ1: In what ways is the aquaculture land transition related to salinity prevalence and history of storm surges,
# accounting for place-invariant factors such as distance/elevation from the sea or soil conditions, or time based shocks such as policy changes, inflation, or market conditions

# RQ2: How do these relationships vary by states? 

# Optional RQ3: Is there a predictive lag between surge impact and land change outcome? 


# Aquaculture Analysis: Panel Data Regression Models
# This script analyzes the relationship between aquaculture land change, storm surges, salinity, and other socio-environmental factors

# As Moran's I is positive, we need to also account for spatial autocorrelation, ie villages near each other tend to have simlar levels of aquaculture => the residuals in the regression may also be spatially autocorrelated violating the classical assumption about independence. 
# vcov at the village level corrects for within-unit correlation over time (serial correlation), and heteroskedasticity within village clusters 
# it does not adjust for spatial dependence between nearby villages
# Try spatially clustered standard errors - Conley Standard Errors that adjust for spatial correlation across observations within a specified distance (5km, 10km...)


# Apart from Tiem and Place FE, we also need to control for place-specific time variant factors that may have their own impact on aquaculture.
# These could be state level policies in a year, level of urbanization and infrastructure, or rainfall (more rains => better agricultural output = less likely to shift) 
# Add these as additional controls and check results

# Time FE: 
# Holding the year constant, when comparing across places, Villages in post-surge years have, on average, 0.608 units higher 5-year average salinity, compared to not affected places. 
# Note that this is a pooled estimate across all villages without controlling for baseline salinity differences between villages.
# This only explains 10% of the variation, and RMSE = 0.8 implies prediction errors are fairly large. 

# Village + Time FE
# This controls for any time-invariant village-level characteristics, like soil type, geographical location with respect to the sea, persistent farming practices, etc.
# When comparing villages to themselves overtime, the relationship of salinity with surges reverses, that is within a given village, salinity is lower by 0.066 units in post-surge periods compared to pre-surge periods.
# Within RÂ² = 0.00022: only a tiny portion of within-village variation in salinity is explained by postSurge.
# This suggests that there maybe systematic differences between places that are affected vs not affected by storms. Those affected by storms are likley to have a higher salinity baseline. 
# while places that are affected by surges have a higher baseline salinity (i.e. are more likely to be saline), they experience relatively less salinity after being affected by storms.

# Time FE
# In non-saline areas, a surge year increases aquaculture by ~0.11% point.

# After a surge, the effect of salinity on aquaculture is lower by 0.16 â Total effect of salinity = 0.24 â 0.16 = ~0.08.
# Salinity is positively associated with aquaculture in normal years.
# After a surge, the strength of that association weakens â perhaps because surge acts as a shock to the existing aquaculture practices or immediate recovery efforts shift behavior.

# Time and village FE: 
# Surges increase aquaculture in low-salinity areas - In villages with zero salinity, surges are associated with a +0.12% point increase in aquaculture.
# Salinity alone does not predict aquaculture in normal years (not significant) - In non-surge years, salinity has a small and statistically insignificant effect on aquaculture.
# Surges amplify salinity-driven aquaculture expansion - After a surge, the effect of salinity increases by ~0.09% point per unit of salinity.
# In normal years, salinity does not have an impact on aquaculture uptake, however, after a surge, salinity becomes a stronger driver of aquaculture.
# This points to interactive adaptation: when a surge occurs in already saline areas, people are more likely to expand aquaculture.
# In villages already facing salinity, storm surges amplify the move toward aquaculture.
# It is not just the surge or salinity alone, but salinity post-surge that accelerates aquaculture expansion.

# Comparing Model 3 and 4 -
# Adding State Ã Year fixed effects in Model 4 reveals that the previously positive average association between storm surges and aquaculture disappears â even turning negative â once state-specific annual shocks are controlled for. 
# However, the interaction between storm surges and persistent salinity becomes even stronger, suggesting that aquaculture expansion is not a generalized response to storm events, but a targeted adaptation in areas where salinity stress is already high. 
# The stable model fit (RÂ²) across specifications indicates that this interaction captures the key localized environmental mechanism driving change, beyond what is explained by broader policy or macroeconomic trends.


# The fact that Conley SEs are larger means that spatial correlation is present â nearby villages are likely experiencing similar shocks or environmental conditions.
# In other words, storm surges and salinity cluster spatially. This validates the core hypothesis that aquaculture expansion is geographically concentrated in areas affected by surges and salinity.
# Significance disappears not because the effect is gone, but because standard errors are now more realistic â accounting for spatial dependence that clustered SEs alone miss.
# The effect sizes (coefficients) remain nearly identical even after controlling for State Ã Year and spatial SEs â they don't shrink.
# The RÂ² stays flat (~0.746â0.747) across all models. This shows: the model fit is stable. Adding spatial controls doesnât explain much more variation, meaning that postSurge and salinity already capture meaningful variation in aquaculture.

# Although the statistical significance of postSurge and persistent salinity weakens under spatial standard errors, 
# the coefficient magnitudes remain robust across specifications. This suggests that their impact on aquaculture is not spurious but embedded in spatially clustered dynamics. 
# In fact, the loss of precision reflects the very nature of the processes we study: storm surges and salinization are spatially concentrated phenomena. 
# The consistency in RÂ² and effect sizes across models confirms the substantive importance of these variables.

# 1990-2000
# In the early periods, salinity is a strong predictor of aquaculture but not surge on its own.  
# Surges in high-salinity areas, in fact, significantly reduce aquaculture â suggesting either destruction of fledgling aquaculture or hesitation to expand under double risk.
# R2 is modest, indicating limited model fit â possibly because aquaculture was still emerging or more heterogeneous.

# 2000-2010
# Surge is dropped due to collienarity suggesting that surges are more uniform across space or time in this period.
# Salinity does not have a significant impact, but the spillover has s tronger negative effect â perhaps indicating oversaturation or environmental degradation deterring further expansion.
# The interaction term loses significance. 
# This period is largely explained by state time factors o past aquaculture. 


# 2010-2020
# Storm surges positively and strongly predict aquaculture, and high magnitude impact (1.1pp)
# There is also a strong surge spillover effect (+2.88pp)
# Salinity and its spillover effects are also significant 
# Interaction loses significance. 

# 2020-2025 
# The main storm surge effect is again collinear â possibly because surges are highly spatially clustered or temporally fixed.
# Interaction between salinity and surge is strongly negative (â0.6 ***), consistent with compound effects limiting aquaculture expansion.
# Lag_Aqua turns negative â suggesting possible saturation or policy/environmental backlash in high-aquaculture areas.



# Overall: 
# Salinity starts out positive, becomes negative, and then weakens
# Storms are initially destructive, then adaptive, and then again interact destructively with salinity in more recent times
# The salinity Ã surge interaction flips in importance â from negative early on (barrier), to insignificant (neutral), to strongly negative again post-2020.
# Suggests compound environmental stressors are increasingly shaping aquaculture decisions.
# The variable postSurge being dropped in some periods implies low within-village variation â perhaps due to fewer new surge events or high storm clustering.

# We observe substantial temporal heterogeneity in the effects of storm surges and salinity on aquaculture expansion over time. 
# In the early period (1990â2000), salinity strongly encouraged aquaculture, but when combined with storm exposure, it deterred expansion. 
# As aquaculture matured (2010â2020), storm surges became positively associated with expansion â possibly indicating adaptation. 
# By 2020â2025, we again observe negative interactive effects, suggesting that repeated exposure to high salinity and storms may be overwhelming adaptive responses.

# Surge in OD's low saline areas = -1.6 + 1.4 = -0.2pp, sig
# Villages near those hit by surges also see small positive spillover effect (+0.22, sig).

# Higher salinity in TN is associated with reduced aquaculture by â0.049 pp.

# Linear effect not significant alone
# Strong curvature effect â suggests increasing returns to salinity for aquaculture in TN.
# Some state-specific nonlinear salinity effects â e.g., salinity effects are stronger OD in higher-order terms.
# A massive, positive coefficient â suggests that in AP, aquaculture after a surge responds very strongly to salinity - maybe visualise it? 

# 5-year average salinity has a nonlinear (convex) effect, meaning aquaculture increases at higher levels of salinity.
# In AP - Aquaculture is highly sensitive to salinity after a surge (strong positive interaction), implying surge and salinity may be joint enablers of expansion.
# In OD - Surge Ã salinity interactions are not significant. Salinity increases aquaculture moderately, but surge may disrupt or delay response.
# Lagged aquaculture is very predictive â suggesting strong path dependence or persistence in village-level aquaculture.

# very highly Significant effects: postSurge in TN ; Lag_Aqua ; higher order levels / non-linear salinity 
# Significant at 1%: postsurge impact of salnity in AP
# Significant at 10%: 
# postsurge in TN and OD
# postSurge x poly(...)1 => after surge, salinity has a more positive effect on aquaculture in TN
# StateAP x poly(...)1 => In AP, salinity effect is more positive/nonlinear than in TN
# postSurge x salinity x StateOD => After surge, Odisha sees a reduced or negative nonlinear effect of salinity on aquaculture

# Aquaculture increases after storm surges on average, but the effect is state-specific.
# The relationship between salinity and aquaculture is clearly U-shaped, i.e. Salinityâaquaculture relationship is nonlinear, but varies by state:
# In AP, high salinity after surges strongly increases aquaculture (adaptive behavior).
# In OD, the surge reduces aquaculture (â1.66), with modest nonlinear effects from salinity. The interaction with surge seems to reverse the potential adaptation to aquacultre - presents itself as a shock. 
# No strong national-level salinity Ã surge interaction, but clear heterogeneity across states.

# Policy implications
# Supports the hypothesis of adaptive aquaculture expansion in response to salinization, especially in AP after surges.
# Emphasizes the importance of regional differences â Odisha may not have similar coping strategies or infrastructure.
# Suggests salinity impacts are nonlinear, which is important for designing thresholds/interventions.
